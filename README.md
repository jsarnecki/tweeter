# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.
Using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the front-end, with Node and Express on the backend, Tweeter uses a simple interface that takes advantage of async JS and XML to present a seamless user experience.  Without the need to refresh, this single page app will continue to post as many tweets as you see fit, as long as you adhere to the 140 character limit.
